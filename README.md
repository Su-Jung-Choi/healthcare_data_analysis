# üè• Patient Wait List Data Visualization using Power BI

## :books: Introduction
This project involves building two interactive dashboards using Power BI for a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data. The objective of the project is to provide insights into patient wait times and service efficiency within a healthcare setting. It enables healthcare providers to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. The dataset contains the patient wait lists from 2018 to 2021.

## Term Definitions
- **Inpatient**: A patient who stays in a hospital while receiving treatment.
  The dataset categorizes inpatients into two groups:
  - Day case: Patients admitted for treatment lasting one day.
  - Inpatient: Patients admitted for treatment lasting more than one day.
- **Outpatient**: A patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to a hospital. These patients typically visit a healthcare facility for consultations, tests, or procedures without staying overnight.
